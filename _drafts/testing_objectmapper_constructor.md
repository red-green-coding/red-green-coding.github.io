# Overview

In [part #1][part-1] of this article, we showed _why you shouldn't mock an ObjectMapper_ in your tests.
The article showed how to improve tests to be more meaningful and accurate by not
mocking third-party code. Instead, we advocated testing using actual third-party code dependencies.

Today, we want to go a step further and improve the quality and maintainability of our tests by _decoupling
our test code from the production code_.

# The problem

Maintaining the codebase can become more complicated when test and production code is too tightly coupled.
When test and production code is too tightly coupled,
adding functionality, even in small ways, causes many tests to break, often in unrelated locations.

Another area is refactorings. We usually want to improve our code base by doing
structural changes that don't change external behavior. With too tightly coupled test and production code, these
refactorings tend to break many tests, though the code still behaves correctly.

Fixing these test failures is an arduous and risky task, as you need to introduce even more changes to the code.
Adding new functionality over time becomes more and more cumbersome.
Refactorings are often avoided as they cause rippling changes through the test code.

If not treated, this process will gradually reduce the quality of the tests, slowing future development even more.

# Maintaining the codebase

Let's look at a small example to understand the problem better.
We use the same example from [part #1][part-1] of this article.

{% highlight java %}
public class MyService1 {
private ObjectMapper mapper;
private CollaboratorService collaborator;

    MyService1(CollaboratorService collaborator, ObjectMapper mapper) {
        this.collaborator = collaborator;
        this.mapper = mapper;
    }

    void useData(String json) {
        try {
            var dto = mapper.readValue(json, MyValue.class);
            collaborator.useValue(dto);
        } catch (IOException e) {
            throw new RuntimeException(e);
        }
    }
}
{% endhighlight %}

Following is the current version of the test

{% highlight java %}
@ExtendWith(MockitoExtension.class)
public class MyService2Test {

    @InjectMocks
    MyService1 myService;

    @Mock
    CollaboratorService collaborator;

    @Spy
    ObjectMapper mapper;

    @Test
    void canConsumeJson() throws Exception {
        var data = """
                {"Name" "MyName", "yearOfBirth": "1973"}
                """;

        myService.useData(data);

        Mockito.verify(collaborator)
            .useValue(Mockito.argThat(arg -> arg.name().equals("MyName")));
    }
}
{% endhighlight %}

Let's assume that for maintenance reasons, we want to do a refactoring.
For example, we want to switch the JSON mapper from Jackon to the alternative implementation [Gson][gson].

{% highlight java %}
public class MyService3 {
private Gson mapper;
private CollaboratorService collaborator;

    MyService3(Gson mapper, CollaboratorService collaborator) {
        this.mapper = mapper;
        this.collaborator = collaborator;
    }

    void useData(String json) {
        try {
            var dto = mapper.fromJson(json, MyDto.class);
            collaborator.useDto(dto);
        } catch (JsonSyntaxException e) {
            throw new RuntimeException(e);
        }
    }
}
{% endhighlight %}

When we re-run our tests, we see that they are failing now.

{% highlight bash %}
sample.MyService3Test

    âœ˜ canConsumeJson()

      NullPointerException: Cannot invoke "com.google.gson.Gson.fromJson(String, java.lang.Class)"
        because "this.mapper"
{% endhighlight %}

# Test code should be decoupled from the code it tests

The reason the test is failing is that the test didn't construct the class under test correctly.
To fix that, we would also need to modify the test. This is the exact situation we want to avoid.

The root cause here is the design choice to put the ObjectMapper as a parameter into the constructor of our class.
In consequence, our test also needs to know which mapper implementation the production code uses so it can construct the test subject.
As the test does not know how to provide the updated dependency, it will fail. _The tests are too tightly coupled to the production code_.

Let's look at how we can improve the situation by decoupling the test from the production code.

# hide implementation details

We will hide the implementation details by removing the mapper parameter from the constructor. Instead, we create the mapper inside our class or
or reference a shared, static instance.

{% highlight java %}
public class MyService4 {
private Gson mapper = new Gson();
private CollaboratorService collaborator;

    MyService4(CollaboratorService collaborator) {
        this.collaborator = collaborator;
    }

    void useData(String json) {
        try {
            var dto = mapper.fromJson(json, MyValue.class);
            collaborator.useValue(dto);
        } catch (JsonSyntaxException e) {
            throw new RuntimeException(e);
        }
    }
}
{% endhighlight %}

{% highlight java %}
@ExtendWith(MockitoExtension.class)
public class MyService4Test {

    @InjectMocks
    MyService4 myService;

    @Mock
    CollaboratorService collaborator;

    @Test
    void canConsumeJson() throws Exception {
        var data = """
                {"name": "MyName", "yearOfBirth": 1973}
                """;

        myService.useData(data);

        Mockito.verify(collaborator)
                .useValue(Mockito.argThat(arg -> arg.name().equals("MyName")));
    }
}
{% endhighlight %}

The change serves several purposes:
* The mapper now is an implementation detail of _MyService_. Our test does not need to be concerned to provide a mapper.
* Consequently, we can now switch mapper libraries without modifying the test.

Looking at the constructor of MyService, we still need to pass in an instance of _CollaboratorService_.
From a design point of view, this is sensible, as _CollaboratorService_ is another functional component of our system, which exists independently of MyService.

We can also express this changed relationship in a UML diagram with association vs. aggregation
* association: MyService _knows_ a CollaboratorService
* aggregation: MyService _owns_ a mapper (footnote: impl detail)

![diagram](/assets/plantuml/testing_objectmapper_constructor/diagram.png)

The underlying problem here is that in the initial design, there is no  differentiation between implementation details
and actual collaborators. All dependencies are passed into the constructor.

We often find this pattern to put all dependencies of a class in its constructor in projects that use dependency injection frameworks. Dependency injection frameworks make it easy to structure your code like that, as the framework will do all the construction work for you.

This ease is continued by the use of mocking frameworks like Mockito, as it again makes it very easy to create our class and just mock
all of its dependencies.

The problem is that these seemingly effortless choices can hurt the long-term maintainability of our codebase.
In our example, the test needs internal knowledge about the production code to construct it for testing.

To improve the design, we should distinguish between collaborators and implementation details when we add dependencies to a class.
When testing, we should carefully decide
if we want to replace the dependency of a class with a mock or use an actual implementation instead. These choices will have an effect on the quality of
the tests and, consequently, on the maintainability of our codebase.

Applying Test-driven development gives you feedback about these kinds of problems. Listen to the tests. If something is not easy to test, then modify your design
to make it easier to test things.

Of course, this is just a tiny example. In real-world projects with tests that are too tightly coupled with production code,
small changes often cause many tests to fail. The time needed to fix these tests can seriously slow down ongoing development and reduce the further adoption of test-driven development
as people conclude that tests hinder development.

# Conclusion

In this article, we showed how we can improve the quality of unit tests by
decoupling tests from production code.

We achieved this by modifying the design of our production code to better distinguish between implementation details
and required dependencies.

This allows us to have tests with less knowledge about the internals of the production code.
These tests allow us to refactor more while requiring fewer test changes afterward.
